Most of the EVs have special apps to control and monitor a lot of parameters. Unfortunately many of them work only in some countries. Many used EVs are sold to other countries where those apps are not supported. That's why EV owners in those countries do not have an option to control their car state remotely.

EV Charge Timer allows to calculate time which is required to charge your EV and set a notification to the calendar.

At the desired time you will get a notification that your car is charged and you can peek it up. That might be very useful if you use a public charger and often forget to take your car in time. This may be also handy at home to have a quick view when you can go.

Some public chargers ask to reserve time. So this app will help you to foresee how much time you need to spend there if you want to fully charge your car.

EV Charge Timer originally was created to support Chevrolet Volt gen 1 in Europe where OnStar is not available. Now trying to extend it to support more car models.

Application does NOT have connection to your car. So it cannot receive actual values like state of charge or the voltage or amperage. This is why charge time calculation is not very accurate. The real time could be different. It depends on many circumstances e.g.: current voltage, amperage, battery chemistry, battery specific charging flow (charging is not linear), temperature, state of charge, age of the battery etc...

To get correct calculations in the settings it is needed to specify some values.
* Voltage and amperage may differ depending on your location and power line. In settings please specify defaults for you.
* Usable battery capacity. Car makers preserve some capacity to extend battery life time. That's why Nissan Leaf with 24 kWh battery has usable capacity about 22 kWh for a new battery. Chevy Volt gen 1 from 16.5kWh can use about 10.5kWh. This value will decrease though the time. Current value of the usable capacity on some cars you can get from the car computers. For other cars you can use OBDII devices. For the rest see car manual or Google it.

Application is on early development stages and could contain bugs. If you encounter that you have correct values but calculated time does not correspond to the actual values and you cannot rely on it please let me know.
